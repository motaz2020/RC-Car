# RC-Car

A project focused on building or controlling a remote-controlled (RC) car, bringing together hardware interfacing, wireless communications, and embedded programming.

## ** Key Functions **
Remote Operation: Typically via Bluetooth or RF.

## ** Control Features **

Forward, backward, left/right, stop commands from a controller or smartphone app.

## ** Sensing: **

Possible inclusion: obstacle detection, speed monitoring, basic autonomy.

### **Hardware Requirements **

Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino/ATMega/PIC variants)

Motor Driver (e.g., L293D)

Bluetooth Module (e.g., HC-05/HC-06) or RF

DC Motors and Wheel Assembly

Power source and basic chassis


## ** Development Ideas **
Add sensors for basic obstacle avoidance.

Integrate with mobile apps for advanced controls.

Introduce semi-autonomy or line-following logic.
